regulations in jurisdictions in which we engage in banking activities, including changes in internal or external data, formulae, models, assumptions or other advanced systems used in the calculation of our capital ratios that cause changes in those ratios as they are measured from period to period; requirements to obtain the prior approval or non-objection of the Federal Reserve or other U.S. and

controls or compliance programs; economic or financial market disruptions in the U.S. or internationally, including those which may result from recessions or political instability; for example, the U.K.'s decision to exit from the European Union may continue to disrupt financial markets or economic growth in Europe or, similarly, financial markets may react sharply or abruptly to actions taken by the new administration in the United States; our ability to develop and execute State Street Beacon, our multi-year transformation program to create cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and to further digitize our processes and interfaces with our clients, any failure of which, in whole or in part, may among other things, reduce our competitive position, diminish the cost-effectiveness of our systems and processes or provide an insufficient return on our associated investment; our ability to promote a strong culture of risk management, operating controls, compliance oversight, ethical behavior and governance that meets our expectations and those of our clients and our regulators, and the financial, regulatory, reputation and other consequences of our failure to meet such expectations; the impact on our compliance and controls enhancement programs associated with the appointment of a monitor under the deferred prosecution

identify other issues that require substantial expenditures, changes in our operations, or payments to clients or reporting to U.S. authorities; the results of our review of our billing practices, including additional findings or amounts we may be required to reimburse clients, as well as potential consequences of such review, including damage to our client relationships or our reputation and adverse actions by governmental authorities; the results of, and costs associated with, governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, litigation and similar claims, disputes; or civil or criminal proceedings; changes or potential changes in the amount of compensation we receive from clients for our services, and the mix of services provided by us that clients choose; the large institutional clients on which we focus are often able to exert considerable market influence and have diverse investment activities, and this, combined with strong competitive market forces, subjects us to significant pressure to reduce the fees we charge, to potentially significant changes in our assets under custody and administration or our assets under management in the event of the acquisition or loss of a client, in whole or in part, and to potentially significant changes in our fee revenue in the event a client re-balances or changes its investment approach or otherwise re-directs assets to lower- or higher-fee asset classes; the potential for losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds; the possibility that our clients will incur substantial losses in investment pools for which we act as agent, and the possibility of significant reductions in the liquidity or valuation of assets underlying those pools; our ability to anticipate and manage the level and timing of redemptions and withdrawals from our collateral pools and other collective investment products; the credit agency ratings of our debt and depositary obligations and investor and client perceptions of our financial strength; adverse publicity, whether specific to State Street or regarding other industry participants or industry-wide factors, or other reputational harm; our ability to control operational risks, data security breach risks and outsourcing risks, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the possibility of errors in the quantitative models we use to manage our business and the possibility that our controls will prove insufficient, fail or be circumvented; our ability to expand our use of technology to enhance the efficiency, accuracy and reliability of our operations and our dependencies on information technology and our ability to control related risks, including cyber-crime and other threats to our information technology infrastructure and systems (including those of our third-party service providers) and their effective operation both independently and with external systems, and complexities and costs of protecting the security of such systems and data; our ability to complete acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, including the ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the ability to arrange financing as required and the ability to satisfy closing conditions; the risks that our acquired businesses and joint ventures will not achieve their anticipated financial, operational and product innovation benefits or will not be integrated successfully, or that the integration will take longer than anticipated, that expected synergies will not be achieved or unexpected negative synergies or liabilities will be experienced, that client and deposit retention goals will not be met, that other regulatory or operational challenges will be experienced, and that disruptions from the transaction will harm our relationships with our clients, our employees or regulators; our ability to recognize evolving needs of our clients and to develop products that are responsive to such trends and profitable to us, the performance of and demand for the products and services we offer, and the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk; our ability to grow revenue, manage expenses, attract and retain highly skilled people and raise the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements and expectations; changes or potential changes to the competitive environment, including changes due to regulatory and technological changes, the effects of industry consolidation and perceptions of State Street as a suitable service provider or counterparty; changes in accounting standards and practices; and changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non-U.S.

outstanding of $683.55 at December 31, 2017, up 13% from $606.30 at December 31, 2016.', 'Earlier this year we added Costa Farms to our portfolio of Markel Ventures companies and we also completed the acquisition of SureTec in our insurance operations.', 'We are excited about the opportunities each of these acquisitions brings to Markel as we continue to focus on building long-term value for our shareholders.""', 'Results attributable to this acquisition are included with our Markel Ventures operations, which are not included in a reportable segment.', 'Markel Ventures Operations\nThe results of Markel Ventures, a diverse portfolio of companies in which we have a controlling interest, are included in other revenues and other expenses.', 'In 2017, other revenues from our Markel Ventures operations were $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion in 2016.', 'Other expenses from our Markel Ventures operations were $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to $1.1 billion in 2016.', 'Net income to shareholders from our Markel Ventures operations was $103.6 million in 2017 compared to $56.2 million in 2016 and earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $177.6 million in 2017 compared to $165.1 million in 2016.', 'See below for a reconciliation of net income to shareholders to Markel Ventures EBITDA.', 'The increase in revenues from our Markel Ventures operations in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of Costa Farms and higher sales volumes in our non-manufacturing operations, partially offset by lower revenues in our manufacturing operations, primarily driven by lower sales volumes at one of our transportation related businesses.', 'Net income to shareholders and EBITDA from our Markel Ventures operations increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due in part to insurance recoveries in excess of 2017 storm losses totaling $44.4 million related to Hurricane Irma.', 'Net income to shareholders from Markel Ventures also increased in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of recording a provisional one-time tax benefit of $37.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 following the enactment of the TCJA, as previously discussed.', 'Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from those predicted are set forth under ""Risk Factors"" and ""Safe Harbor and Cautionary Statement"" in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or are included in the items listed below:\nour expectations about future results of our underwriting, investing and other operations are based on current knowledge and assume no significant man-made or natural catastrophes, no significant changes in products or personnel and no adverse changes in market conditions; the effect of cyclical trends on our underwriting, investing and other operations, including demand and pricing in the insurance, reinsurance and other markets in which we operate; actions by competitors, including the application of new or ""disruptive"" technologies or business models and consolidation, and the effect of competition on market trends and pricing; we offer insurance and reinsurance coverage against terrorist acts in connection with some of our programs, and in other instances we are legally required to offer terrorism insurance; in both circumstances, we actively manage our exposure, but if there is a covered terrorist attack, we could sustain material losses; the frequency and severity of man-made and natural catastrophes (including earthquakes, fires and weather-related catastrophes) may exceed expectations, are unpredictable and, in the case of fires and weather-related catastrophes, may be exacerbated if, as many forecast, conditions in the oceans and atmosphere result in increased hurricane, flood, drought or other adverse weather-related activity; emerging claim and coverage issues, changing legal and social trends, and inherent uncertainties in the loss estimation process can adversely impact the adequacy of our loss reserves and our allowance for reinsurance recoverables; reinsurance reserves are subject to greater uncertainty than insurance reserves, primarily because of reliance upon the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies and the longer lapse of time from the occurrence of loss events to their reporting to the reinsurer for ultimate resolution; changes in the assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves for our life and annuity reinsurance book (which is in runoff), for example, changes in assumptions and estimates of mortality, longevity, morbidity and interest rates, could result in material increases in our estimated loss reserves for such business; adverse developments in insurance coverage litigation or other legal or administrative proceedings could result in material increases in our estimates of loss reserves; the failure or inadequacy of any loss limitation methods we employ; changes in the availability, costs and quality of reinsurance coverage, which may impact our ability to write or continue to write certain lines of business; the ability or willingness of reinsurers or capacity providers to pay balances due may be adversely affected by industry and economic conditions, deterioration in reinsurer or capacity provider credit quality and coverage disputes; after the commutation of ceded reinsurance contracts, any subsequent adverse development in the re-assumed loss reserves will result in a charge to earnings; regulatory actions can impede our ability to charge adequate rates and efficiently allocate capital; general economic and market conditions and industry specific conditions, including extended economic recessions or expansions; prolonged periods of slow economic growth; inflation or deflation; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity and energy prices and interest rates; volatility in the credit and capital markets; and other factors; economic conditions, actual or potential defaults in municipal bonds or sovereign debt obligations, volatility in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and changes in market value of concentrated investments can have a significant impact on the fair value of our fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as the carrying value of our other assets and liabilities, and this impact may be heightened by market volatility; economic conditions may adversely affect our access to capital and credit markets; the effects of government intervention, including material changes in the monetary policies of central banks, to address financial downturns and economic and currency concerns; the impacts that political and civil unrest and regional conflicts may have on our businesses and the markets they serve or that any disruptions in regional or worldwide economic conditions generally arising from these situations may have on our businesses, industries or investments; the impacts that health epidemics and pandemics may have on our business operations and claims activity; the impact on our businesses of the repeal, in part or in whole, or modification of U.S. health care reform legislation and regulations; changes in U.S. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate; we are dependent upon operational effectiveness and security of our enterprise information technology systems and those maintained by third parties; if one or more of those systems fail or suffer a security breach, our businesses or reputation could be adversely impacted; our acquisitions may increase our operational and control risks for a period of time; we may not realize the contemplated benefits, including cost savings and synergies, of our acquisitions; any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets; the loss of services of any executive officer or other key personnel could adversely impact one or more of our operations; our substantial international operations and investments expose us to increased political, operational and economic risks, including foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk; the vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, which could have adverse consequences for our businesses, particularly our London-based international insurance operations; our ability to raise third party capital for existing or new investment vehicles and risks related to our management of third party capital; the effectiveness of our procedures for compliance with existing and ever increasing guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards, rules, laws and regulations; the impact of economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs on our businesses, including instances in which the requirements and limitations applicable to the global operations of U.S. companies and their affiliates are more restrictive than those applicable to non-U.S. companies and their affiliates; regulatory changes, or challenges by regulators, regarding the use of certain issuing carrier or fronting arrangements; our dependence on a limited number of distribution partners and capacity providers for a large portion of our revenues and third-party capital; adverse changes in our assigned financial strength or debt ratings could adversely impact us, including our ability to attract and retain business and the availability and cost of capital; and a number of additional factors may adversely affect our Markel Ventures operations, and the markets they serve, and negatively impact their revenues and profitability, including, among others: adverse weather conditions, plant disease and other contaminants; changes in government support for education, healthcare and infrastructure projects; changes in capital spending levels; changes in the housing market; liability for environmental matters; volatility in the market prices for their products; and volatility in commodity prices and interest and foreign currency exchange rates.', ""Any person interested in listening to the call should contact Markel's

investments.', 'In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Ares Capital’s investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly.', 'This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to Ares Capital’s initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors.', 'Under this system, investments with a grade of 4 involve the least amount of risk to Ares Capital’s initial cost basis.', 'Investments graded 3 involve a level of risk to Ares Capital’s initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to Ares Capital’s initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition.', 'This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to Ares Capital’s ability to ultimately recoup the cost of Ares Capital’s investment are neutral to favorable.', 'Investments graded 2 indicate that the risk to Ares Capital’s ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due.', 'An investment grade of 1 indicates that the risk to Ares Capital’s ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance.', 'For investments graded 1, it is anticipated that Ares Capital will not recoup Ares Capital’s initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of Ares Capital’s initial cost basis upon exit.', 'For investments graded 1 or 2, Ares Capital’s investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.', 'Ares Capital assigned a fair value on January 3, 2017 (the “Acquisition Date”), which was the date we closed the American Capital Acquisition, to each of the portfolio investments acquired in connection with the American Capital Acquisition.', 'As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the weighted average grade of the investments in Ares Capital’s portfolio at fair value was 3.1 and 3.1, respectively, and loans on non-accrual status represented 3.1% and 2.9%,

guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act.', 'The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by Ares Capital, in its discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors.', 'From January 1, 2018 through February 8, 2018, Ares Capital made new

interest rates, and the ratio of corporate profits to national income.', 'For Buffett, those are the fundamentals, the twin pistons that power stocks.', 'Since those are precisely today’s conditions, investors should pay close attention to Buffett’s analysis.', 'What earnings and rates tell us According to Buffett’s analysis, the principal fundamental that guides Wall Street, the prospect of strong economic growth, is actually relatively unimportant in forecasting the performance of equities.', 'For example, Buffett shows that if profits are already extremely elevated today, they’re likely to lag in the future, even if the economy expands at a brisker-than-average pace.', 'Buffett is warning about a different disconnect: Super-high prices and rampant optimism, versus fundamental factors signaling lean times ahead.', 'Buffett compares how these fundamentals at the start of each period shaped the market’s performance over two, seventeen-year spans.', 'As Buffett states in the article, “The higher the rate, the greater the downward pull.', 'Although Buffett doesn’t say so, that particular jump in yields came from two sources.', 'For Buffett, that was the best of all places to launch, because a mere return to normal in both categories guaranteed super results.', 'The reason wasn’t an explosion in GDP, confirming Buffett’s view that overall growth isn’t a critical factor in equity returns.', 'A glum prediction comes true The point of Buffett’s analysis was to assess the outlook in 1999, at the end of that fabulous run.', 'Buffett stated that investors who expected double-digit returns would be sorely disappointed.', '“Investors in stocks these days are expecting far too much,” Buffett said, forecasting that folks would reap total returns, including dividends, of a maximum of 6.5% a year.', 'Buffett predicted that the neither of the two big drivers was likely to improve from their current levels, because they’d already registered such favorable moves in the previous period.', 'But the markets suffered a counter-punch that Buffett warned about-a big contraction in valuations.', 'Buffett observed that stocks were extremely pricey in 1999.', 'Buffett noted that investors might not be willing to pay such rich prices for long.', 'And even though the last seven years of that span (2009-15) included a roaring bull market, all told, stocks performed even worse than Buffett predicted.', 'Warning signals So what does Buffett’s methodology tell us about the current period?', 'Listen to Buffett in 1999: “If an investor is to achieve juicy profits in the market over the next ten years or 17 or 20, one or more of three things must happen: (1) Interest rates must fall further.', '(2) Corporate profitability in relation to GDP must rise.”\nToday, Buffett’s two main fundamentals are much more stretched than in 1999, when he wrongly believed that they’d reached the danger point.', 'But the third factor Buffett mentioned further darkens the outlook.', 'The 1999 article marked one of the few times that Buffett discussed the general level of stock prices.', 'So in no way does this article purport to reflect current Buffett’s thinking.', 'But Buffett’s 1999 primer provides the tools for assessing what’s ahead.', 'Buffett was predicting mediocre returns in 1999, when the fundamentals weren’t nearly this stretched.', ' Ex-Celgene chief

credit performance remaining consistent with current expectations; the impact of any future contingencies, including, but not limited to, litigation-related settlements, judgments or expenses, the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, an increase in Card Member reimbursements, restructurings, impairments and changes in reserves; the ability to control operating expense growth; the amount the Company spends on Card Member engagement and the Company’s ability to drive growth from such investments; changes in interest rates beyond current expectations (including the impact of hedge ineffectiveness and deposit rate increases); a greater impact from certain cobrand agreements than expected, which could be affected by volumes and Card Member engagement; the impact of regulation and litigation, which could affect the profitability of the Company’s business activities, limit the Company’s ability to pursue business opportunities, require changes to business practices or alter the Company’s relationships with partners, merchants and Card Members; the Company’s tax rate remaining in line with current expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, changes to the fourth quarter 2017 provisional tax charge due to changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made as well as actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company’s geographic mix of income, further changes in tax laws and regulation, unfavorable tax audits and other unanticipated tax items; and the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications; the ability of the Company to grow revenues net of interest expense consistent with its expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, weakening economic conditions in the United States or internationally, a decline in consumer confidence impacting the willingness and ability of Card Members to sustain and grow spending, continued growth of Card Member loans, a greater erosion of the average discount rate than expected, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, more cautious spending by corporate Card Members, the willingness of Card Members to pay higher card fees, lower spending on new cards acquired than estimated; and the Company’s ability to address competitive pressures and implement its strategies and business initiatives, including within the premium consumer segment, commercial payments, the global network and digital environment; changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry, including competitive pressure that may impact the prices charged to merchants that accept American Express cards, competition for cobrand relationships, competition from new and non-traditional competitors and the success of marketing, promotion or rewards programs; the erosion of the average discount rate by a greater amount than anticipated, including as a result of changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, merchant negotiations (including merchant incentives, concessions and volume-related pricing discounts), competition, pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors’ interchange rates in the European Union and elsewhere), a greater shift of existing merchants into the OptBlue program and other factors; the Company’s delinquency and write-off rates and growth of provisions for losses being higher or lower than current expectations, which will depend in part on changes in the level of loan and receivable balances and delinquencies, mix of balances, loans and receivables related to new Card Members and other borrowers performing as expected, credit performance of new and enhanced lending products, unemployment rates, the volume of bankruptcies, collections capabilities and recoveries of previously written-off loans and receivables; the Company’s ability to continue to grow loans, which may be affected by increasing competition, brand perceptions and reputation, the Company’s ability to manage risk, the behavior of Card Members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns, and the Company’s ability to issue new and enhanced card products, offer attractive non-card lending products, capture a greater share of existing Card Members’ spending and borrowings, reduce Card Member attrition and attract new customers; the Company’s net interest yield on Card Member loans not remaining consistent with current levels, which will be influenced by, among other things, interest rates, changes in consumer behavior that affect loan balances, such as paydown rates, the Company’s Card Member acquisition strategy, product mix, cost of funds, credit actions, including line size and other adjustments to credit availability, potential pricing changes and deposit rates, which could be impacted by, among other things, changes in benchmark interest rates, competitive pressure and regulatory constraints; the Company’s rewards expense and cost of Card Member services growing inconsistently from expectations, which will depend in part on Card Member behavior as it relates to their spending patterns, including the level of spend in bonus categories, and the redemption of rewards and offers, as well as the degree of interest of Card Members in the value proposition offered by the Company; increasing competition, which could result in greater rewards offerings; the Company’s ability to enhance card products and services to make them attractive to Card Members; and the amount the Company spends on the promotion of enhanced services and rewards categories and the success of such promotion; the actual amount to be spent on marketing and business development, which will be based in part on management’s assessment of competitive opportunities; overall business performance and changes in macroeconomic conditions; the actual amount of advertising and Card Member acquisition costs; the Company’s ability to continue to shift Card Member acquisition to digital channels; contractual obligations with business partners and other fixed costs and prior commitments; management’s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and make such investments, which could be impacted by business, regulatory or legal complexities; and the Company’s ability to realize efficiencies, optimize investment spending and control expenses to fund such spending; the ability of the Company to control operating expense growth, which could be impacted by the need to increase significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, including as a result of increased litigation, compliance or regulatory-related costs or fraud costs; continuing to implement and achieve benefits from reengineering plans, which could be impacted by factors such as an inability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by potential staff reductions and underestimating hiring and other employee needs; an inability to innovate efficient channels of customer interactions, such as chat supported by artificial intelligence, or customer acquisition; higher than expected employee levels; the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs; the payment of civil money penalties, disgorgement, restitution, non-income tax assessments and litigation-related settlements; impairments of goodwill or other assets; management’s decision to increase or decrease spending in such areas as technology, business and product development and sales forces; greater-than-expected inflation; and the level of M&A activity and related expenses; changes affecting the Company’s plans regarding the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which will depend on factors such as the pace at which the Company is able to rebuild its capital levels and regulatory capital ratios, including from earnings and a lower effective tax rate; changes in the stress testing and capital planning process and the approval of the Company’s capital plans by its primary regulators in 2018; the amount the Company spends on acquisitions of companies; and the Company’s results of operations and the economic environment in any given period; uncertainty relating to the ultimate outcome of the antitrust lawsuit filed against the Company by the U.S. Department of Justice and certain state attorneys general, including the review of the case by the U.S. Supreme Court and the impact on existing private merchant cases and potentially additional litigation and/or arbitrations; a failure in or breach of the Company’s operational or security systems, processes or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks, which could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security of data, disrupt our operations, reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and lead to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, remediation and response costs, and reputational harm; the Company’s deposit rates increasing faster or slower than current expectations and changes affecting the Company’s ability to accept, maintain or grow Personal Savings deposits due to market demand, changes in benchmark interest rates or regulatory restrictions on the Company’s ability to obtain deposit funding or offer competitive interest rates, which could affect the Company’s net interest yield and ability to fund its businesses; legal and regulatory developments, which could require the Company to make fundamental changes to many of its business practices, including our ability to continue certain GNS and other partnerships;

of new investment commitments included commitments to 11 new portfolio companies, 21 existing portfolio companies and one additional portfolio company through the Senior Direct Lending Program, LLC (the “SDLP”), through which Ares Capital co-invests with Varagon Capital Partners (“Varagon”) and its clients to fund first lien senior secured loans.', 'As of March 31, 2018, 176 separate private equity sponsors were represented in Ares Capital’s portfolio.', 'Ares Capital may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that Ares Capital will be able to do so.', 'In the first quarter of 2018, significant new commitments included:\n$425 million related to the Portfolio Acquisition, including $162 million funded directly by Ares Capital to purchase loans and the remaining $263 million in a subordinated loan and equity funded by Ares Capital to IHAM, Ares Capital’s wholly owned portfolio company, to help support IHAM’s acquisition of the remaining portfolio acquired by IHAM; $212 million in a first lien senior secured term loan, second lien senior secured delayed draw and term loans and equity of an auto parts

manufacturer.', 'Also in the first quarter of 2018, Ares Capital exited approximately $1,342 million of investment commitments (including exits of $221 million of commitments acquired as part of the American Capital Acquisition).', 'The fair value of Ares Capital’s portfolio investments at March 31, 2018 was $12.2 billion, including $10.6 billion in accruing debt and other income producing securities.', 'This growth was driven by progress on our portfolio rotation initiatives, the increased utilization of our 30% basket and the benefit from higher interest rates,” said Kipp deVeer, Chief Executive Officer of Ares Capital.', '“We continue to maintain a conservatively leveraged balance sheet that is asset sensitive and that we believe is positioned to further benefit if interest rates continue to rise.”\nPORTFOLIO QUALITY\nAres Capital Management LLC (“Ares Capital Management” or Ares Capital’s “investment adviser”) employs an investment rating system to categorize Ares Capital’s investments.', 'In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Ares Capital’s investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly.', 'This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to Ares Capital’s initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors.', 'Under this system, investments with a grade of 4 involve the least amount of risk to Ares Capital’s initial cost basis.', 'Investments graded 3 involve a level of risk to Ares Capital’s initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to Ares Capital’s initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition.', 'This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to Ares Capital’s ability to ultimately recoup the cost of Ares Capital’s investment are neutral to favorable.', 'Investments graded 2 indicate that the risk to Ares Capital’s ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due.', 'An investment grade of 1 indicates that the risk to Ares Capital’s ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance.', 'For investments graded 1, it is anticipated that Ares Capital will not recoup Ares Capital’s initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of Ares Capital’s initial cost basis upon exit.', 'For investments graded 1 or 2, Ares Capital’s investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.', 'As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the weighted average grade of the investments in Ares Capital’s portfolio at fair value was 3.1 and 3.1, respectively, and loans on non-accrual status represented 2.7% and 3.1%, respectively, of total investments at amortized cost (or 1.0% and 1.4%, respectively, at fair value).', 'LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nIn January 2018, Ares Capital issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on March 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”).', 'The 2025 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at Ares Capital’s option at any time at the redemption prices as determined pursuant to the indenture governing the 2025 Notes.', 'In January 2018, Ares Capital repaid in full the $270 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes (the “2018 Convertible Notes”) upon their maturity.', 'In March 2018, Ares Capital amended and restated its senior secured credit facility (as amended, the “Revolving Credit Facility”).', 'The Revolving Credit Facility, among other things, (a) extended the expiration of the revolving period for $1.6 billion of commitments of the lenders electing to extend their commitments from January 4, 2021 to March 30, 2022, during which period Ares Capital, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, and (b) extended the stated maturity date for $1.6 billion of commitments of the lenders electing to extend their revolving commitments from January 4, 2022 to March 30, 2023.', 'The Revolving Credit Facility includes an “accordion” feature that allows Ares Capital, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility by an amount up to $1.0 billion.', 'As of March 31, 2018, Ares Capital had $302 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5.2 billion in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding ($5.1 billion at carrying value).', 'Subject to leverage, borrowing base and other restrictions, Ares Capital had approximately $2.5 billion available for additional borrowings under its existing credit facilities as of March 31, 2018.', 'FIRST QUARTER 2018 DIVIDEND\nOn February 13, 2018, Ares Capital declared a first quarter dividend of $0.38 per share for a total of approximately $162 million.', 'On April 2, 2018, Ares Capital announced that it plans to recommend a path for approval to reduce its asset coverage ratio to 150% and will discuss specific plans for implementation with its board of directors and other constituents as it completes its evaluation of the various alternatives.', 'In April 2018, Ares Capital’s consolidated subsidiary, Ares Venture Finance, L.P., surrendered its license to operate as a Small Business Investment Company and the undrawn Small Business Administration-guaranteed debenture commitments of $50 million were terminated.', 'From April 1, 2018 through April 26, 2018, Ares Capital made new investment commitments of approximately $736 million, of which $538 million were funded.', 'Ares Capital may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.', 'From April 1, 2018 through April 26, 2018, Ares Capital exited approximately $362 million of investment commitments, including $21 million of investment commitments acquired in the American Capital Acquisition.', 'On the approximately $362 million of investment commitments exited from April 1, 2018 through April 26, 2018, Ares Capital recognized total net realized gains of approximately $2 million.', 'In addition, as of April 26, 2018, Ares Capital had an investment backlog and pipeline of approximately $755 million and $105 million, respectively.', 'Investment backlog includes transactions approved by Ares Capital’s investment adviser’s investment committee and/or for which a formal mandate, letter of intent or a signed commitment have been issued, and therefore Ares Capital believes are likely to close.', 'The consummation of any of the investments in this backlog and pipeline depends upon, among other things, one or more of the following: satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of the prospective portfolio company, Ares Capital’s acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation.', 'In addition, Ares Capital may sell all or a portion of these investments and certain of these investments may result in the repayment of existing investments.', 'Ares Capital cannot assure you that it will make any of these investments or that Ares Capital will sell all or any portion of these investments.', 'WEBCAST / CONFERENCE CALL\nAres Capital will host a webcast/conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 12:00 p.m. (ET) to

didn’t go into Apple because it was a tech stock in the least,” Buffett explained at the Berkshire meeting.', '“I went into Apple because I came to certain conclusions about both the intelligence with the capital they deploy, but more important the value of their ecosystem and how permanent that ecosystem could be.”\nApple, whose stock hit a new record high Monday, has been a major winner for Berkshire Hathaway: Apple’s stock price has roughly doubled in the two years since Berkshire initially disclosed its stake.', 'Buffett is a big fan of so-called economic moats , or advantages that allow companies to retain their customers despite the competition—which for Apple is the iPhone, he said.', '“We’re betting on the success of Apple products like the iPhone, and I see characteristics in that that make me think it’s extraordinary,” Buffett said.', 'But there’s another reason Buffett loves Apple besides its tech gadgets: Apple’s massive cash hoard, which allows it to buy back a lot of its own stock.', 'While stock buybacks are a controversial way for companies to spend cash that they could otherwise invest in growth or acquisitions, Buffett said that in Apple’s case it makes sense.', '“I think it’s extremely hard to find acquisitions that would be accretive to Apple that would be in the $50 billion, or $100 billion or $200 billion range,” Buffett said.', '“I’m delighted to see them repurchasing shares.”\nApple’s buybacks also mean that Berkshire Hathaway, which owns roughly 5% of Apple’s outstanding shares, could end up owning a larger percentage chunk of the tech company in the future—simply because there will be fewer shares left after Apple buys them up.', '“I love the idea of having our 5% grow to 6 or 7% without us laying out a dime,” Buffett said.', '“It’s worked for us in many other situations.”\nAlthough investors enjoy speculating on which companies Apple should acquire , Buffett, ironically, is quite pessimistic about its M&A potential.', '“As I look around the horizon, I don’t see anything that would make a lot of sense for them [to buy] in terms of what they’d have to pay and what they would get,” said Buffett, who is known for investing in low-priced stocks.', '“Like I say, [Apple CEO] Tim Cook can do simple math and he can probably do very complicated math too,” Buffett added.', "" Warren Buffett: Berkshire Hathaway

to emulate Buffett’s stock-picking prowess.', 'At the Berkshire Hathaway meeting Saturday, Buffett held court on stage—alongside his right-hand man and jokester Charlie Munger —and fielded questions from shareholders for almost six hours straight.', 'As is typical, Buffett’s responses ran the gamut, covering his outlook on a potential trade war with China, his love of Apple stock, his mistake not buying Google or Amazon stock, his health care venture with Amazon and JPMorgan Chase , and even his differences with Tesla CEO Elon Musk .', 'One underlying theme: Buffett, at age 87, is “bullish”—on
